This webpage allows users to search for resources for homeless people by location via a simple icon based interface. Ideally it would be in the post office on permanent interfaces for homeless people to access directly. It should be viewable in different languages.
Resources include food, shelter, medical, transportation, crisis, and legal. Updated
